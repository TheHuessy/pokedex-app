## Pokedex App
A project to create [yet another] pokedex app. This will be a flask based web app, served and accessed locally. Features we wish to include:

* Basic info about pokemon
* Learned and taught move info
* Evolution chains
* Location Dex
* Egg Move Calculator


### Current Steps:

* Explore Serebii.net and build out scraping schemas
* Create DAG/Map out local database schemas (relational database)
* Write + test scraper
* Perform ETL on all pokemon (need master list of names too)
